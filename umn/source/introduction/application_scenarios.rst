Application Scenarios
=====================

Anti-DDoS defends only EIPs against DDoS attacks.

Anti-DDoS devices are deployed at egresses of data centers. :ref:`Figure 1 <en-us_topic_0204851500__fig5732364017363>` shows the network topology.

The detection center detects network access traffic according to user-configured security policies. If an attack is detected, data is diverted to cleaning devices for real-time defense. Abnormal traffic is cleaned, and normal traffic is forwarded.
