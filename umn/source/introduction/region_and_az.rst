Region and AZ
=============

A region is a geographic area where resources used by Anti-DDoS are located.

Availability zones (AZs) in the same region can communicate with each other over the intranet, but those in different regions cannot.

The public cloud has data centers in different regions around the world. Therefore, Anti-DDoS can be used in different regions. Anti-DDoS is designed to meet users' customized requirements or local legal or other requirements in different regions.

Each region contains many AZs where power and networks are physically isolated. AZs in the same region can communicate with each other over the intranet. Each AZ provides cost-effective and low-latency network connections that are unaffected by faults that may occur in other AZs. Therefore, deploying Anti-DDoS in separate AZs protects your applications against local faults that occur in a specific location.
