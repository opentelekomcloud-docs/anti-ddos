What Is Anti-DDoS?
==================

The Anti-DDoS traffic cleaning service (Anti-DDoS for short) defends elastic IP addresses (EIPs) against network- and application-layer distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and sends alarms immediately when detecting an attack. In addition, Anti-DDoS improves the utilization of bandwidth and ensures the stable running of users' services.

Anti-DDoS monitors the service traffic from the Internet to EIPs to detect attack traffic in real time. It then cleans attack traffic according to user-configured defense policies so that services run as normal. In addition, monitoring reports are generated, presenting users with clear network security evaluations.
