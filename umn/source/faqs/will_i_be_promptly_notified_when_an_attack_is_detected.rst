Will I Be Promptly Notified When an Attack Is Detected?
=======================================================

You will be promptly notified when an attack is detected after you have enabled alarm notification.

On the Anti-DDoS console page, click the **Alarm Notifications** tab and enable the alarm notification function. Then you will receive notifications (by SMS or email) if a DDoS attack is detected.
