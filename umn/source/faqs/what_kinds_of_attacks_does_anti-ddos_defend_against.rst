What Kinds of Attacks Does Anti-DDoS Defend Against?
====================================================

Anti-DDoS helps users cope with traffic attacks with ease. It can precisely identify connection exhaustion and slow-connection attacks and can help users defend against the following attacks:

-  Web server attacks

   Such as SYN flood, HTTP flood, Challenge Collapsar (CC), and slow-connection attacks

-  Game attacks

   Such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flood, SYN flood, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and fragment attacks

-  HTTPS server attacks

   Such as SSL DoS and DDoS attacks

-  DNS server attacks

   Such as attacks targeted at vulnerabilities in the Domain Name Server (DNS) protocol stack, DNS reflection attacks, DNS flood attacks, and DNS cache-miss attacks
